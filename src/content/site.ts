 * within a second of the overlay clearing, and a preloader that repeats it reads
 * as filler. A greeting is the one thing the page has no reason to say twice, and
 * it is what makes the language jump legible as a language jump.
 *
 * Two constraints produced this exact list:
 *
 * - **Lengths alternate** (5, 7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 5, plus conjuncts). The preloader
 *   sets one fluid type size for the whole run, so the size changes are what
 *   keep a single clamp from looking oversized on "Hola" and undersized on
 *   "Bonjour".
 * - **No cursive script.** The reveal masks each character separately, which
 *   would shatter Arabic joining and leave a row of isolated letterforms. Latin,
 *   Cyrillic, Han, and Devanagari all survive per-character masking; Arabic does
 *   not. Add "مرحبا" here and it will render broken.
